Redesigned GitHub Dashboard
===========================

What Sucks
----------

1. Try telling these icons apart:

    * &xf001;
    * &xf002;
    * &xf003;
    * &xf004;
    * &xf005;
    * &xf006;

    Now imagine them as white icons on purple (`##7552A1`) background.

    The people at GitHub somehow thought this was a good idea.
